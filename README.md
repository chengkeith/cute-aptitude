Cut-E Aptitude Test for Airline Pilot Interview

About
-----
As I was preparing myself for my airline pilot interview, I found that there is no available exercises for me to practise the aptitude test.  Therefore I made one myself.  It is also a good chance for me to practise drawing using `<canvas>` and `<svg>` elements.
